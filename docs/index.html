  <h1>Brass Monkey Flash SDK</h1>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is the start of the new documentation for the public Brass Monkey Flash SDK. This will be constantly expanded to include new tutorials and examples. Stay tuned.</p>
  
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>All example projects are in the <strong>examples/</strong> directory. Here we give a brief overview of each example and list accompanying tutorials.</p>
  
  <p>To run examples import them into a Flash Builder workspace. Right-Click the demo of choice and choose to 'debug' or 'run' as a 'Web Application'. Debugging will require the flash player debugger runtime, available in the adobe.com player downloads page. Also make sure to import the 'SharedResources' project that contains many libraries needed, including the Brass Monkey SWC file.</p>
  
  <h3>BootCamp</h3>
  <p>Boot Camp  explains some basic concepts about brass monkey.  How it uses the flash eventing system and client-handlers. 20 minutes is the expected time for developers who are using an API for the first time. Just like working with FMS  or any other asynchronous service for the first time, there are a few basic things to go over. The two tutorials are  1)a simple gravity controlled drawing application and 2)a monkey animation that dances with your device's  position(its creepy). See: <a href="../examples/BootCamp/BrassMonkeyIn20Minutes.pdf">Brass Monkey In 20 Minutes</a></p>

  <h3>DynamicControls</h3>
  <p>From the most benign control designs that use the API in the minimalist way, to extreme control pad manipulation that rely  on very few in-built methods by handling the serialized portable network graphics directly. </p>
  <p>See: <a href="dynamic-controls/dynamic-controls.html">Dynamic Controls</a></p>
 
  <h3>ControlSchemes</h3>
  <p>Several different topics related to Control Schemes are covered. From advanced methods that  change the Hit Rects  of the  buttons or   alter the Sample Mode used while scaling to the different screen sizes, to the text components and aspect ratio API that help your design to be presented in the best possible way. </p>
  
  <h4>Hit Rects</h4>
  <p>This example shows how to setup a button that has hit area that is separate from it's visual location.</p>
  
  <p>See: <a href="button-hit-rect/button-hit-rect.html">Simple Hit Rect</a></p>
  
  <h4>Image Sample Modes</h4>
   <p>Graphics may be scaled to fit different screen sizes. There are two ways to designate how they are interpolated. This demo sets up a dramatically scaled button and allows you to toggle the image stretch/resampling mode by pressing it.</p>
  <p>See: <a href="image-sample-modes/image-sample-modes.html">Image Sample Modes</a></p>

  <h4>Aspect Ratio API</h4>
   An long explanation of the aspect ratio API  with a simple demo to get your designs to look correctly  on your targeted screen sizes. It also shows how your design size will define the touch values of all the device-clients who load it and allow you a singular path to program them. 
  <p>See: <a href="image-sample-modes/image-sample-modes.html">Image Sample Modes</a></p>
   
   <h4>Text Components</h4>
   An explanation of the two ways to put text on the control design, as well as creating control designs as devices connect and customized at run-time. 
  <p>See: <a href="image-sample-modes/image-sample-modes.html">Image Sample Modes</a></p> 
 
 
  <h3>DeviceMotion</h3>
  <p>This example shows how to enable and receive Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Orientation, and Shake events.</p>

   
  <h3>ControlMenu</h3>
  <p>Just like the Flash ContextMenu API, which is the menu you see with a right-click,  the control pad also has a context menu that you can script with. You can add setting menus or sound control buttons. </p>

  <p>
    If you've never used a flash library before, then we expect this will take you twenty minutes. You may learn few basic concepts about asynchronous  service calls and client-handlers. If you have worked with flash a little bit more, than we expect you'll learn a few things about controls designs basics.  For the seasoned or mildly experienced developer, we would recommend that you read the boot camp  companion-document and the dynamic controls document and proceed to the other demos directly.  </p>
